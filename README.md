* [Antiyoy Wikia](http://antiyoy.wikia.com/wiki/Antiyoy_Wikia)
* [Antiyoy on GitHub](https://github.com/yiotro/Antiyoy)

## TODO
* Add testing

* Implement Game 1 described in the rules in the index.html



* In game drawing click on a hexagon allow to set it as part of an area
* Button to "download board" will download a json file representing the board.
* Button to "upload board" will allow us to upload a json file representing a board.

* We can check if a map is continuous. Though we might want to allow distinct parts in advanced version of the game.
