## TODO
* Add testing

* Game 1
  A simple board with two players.
  Each player has one territory and on that one soldier.
  In each move they can move N distance, and enlarge the territory.
  When no more free territory is left the game is over. The one with more territory wins.




* In game drawing click on a hexagon allow to set it as part of an area
* Button to "download board" will download a json file representing the board.
* Button to "upload board" will allow us to upload a json file representing a board.

* We can check if a map is continuous. Though we might want to allow distinct parts in advanced version of the game.
